- Dating Compatibility Embedding - build and evaluate a domain-specific embedding model fine-tuned using contrastive loss on synthetic data with sklearn, SentenceTransformers, PyTorch.
- Built ‚ÄúLLM-as-Judge‚Äù evaluation using synthetic Data QA for DIY/Repair. created chat with Vercel AI Toolkit, ShadCN UI, FastAPI, OpenAI, Pydantic.
- Multi-Agent Gen AI system for a tennis team league, using CrewAI, Langchain Gmail and GCP.
- Processed medical receipts with Zapier AI agents, integrating Gmail, WhatsApp, Google Sheets, image/PDF parsing.
- A multi-agent CrewAI system that learns your communication style, retrieves accurate info from PDFs, evaluates responses for style and grounding, and books meetings if confidence is low.
