Senior Full-Stack Developer with deep experience building scalable enterprise systems, now focused on GenAI innovation. Proven track record in full-stack development (React, Node, Java, Python), monorepo architecture, and rapid prototyping. Currently expanding expertise in AI/LLM application development through hands-on projects and formal training.

Currently expanding expertise in AI/LLM application development through hands-on projects and formal training in **AI Developer Bootcamp, [Newline](https://newline.notion.site/AI-bootcamp-1-cohort-curriculum-1303f12eb0228088a11dc779897d15bd)** covered Python, statistics, prompt engineering, RAG systems, transformer architectures, multimodal apps, fine tuning, model evaluation and agentic AI.

Check some of my AI projects:

- [Basic RAG with Eval](https://github.com/ipassynk/rag-full-cycle) RAG pipeline using Python, Ollama, and Vector DB Pinecone for ingestion, embedding, and retrieval and metric calculation.
- [Dating Compatibility Embedding](https://github.com/ipassynk/digital-clone-agent) - fine tune domain-specific model  using contrastive loss on synthetic data with scikit-learn, SentenceTransformers, PyTorch.
- [LLM-as-Judge for evaluationing Data QA for DIY/Repair](https://github.com/ipassynk/repair-diy-ai). AI chat with Vercel AI Toolkit, ShadCN UI, FastAPI, OpenAI, Pydantic.
- [Tennis Email](https://github.com/ipassynk/tennis-email-agent) Multi-agent CrewAI for automating tennis league match organization using custom and LangChain Gmail tools, and GCP.
- [Digital Clone Agent](https://github.com/ipassynk/digital-clone-agent) Multi-agent LangGraph agent that learns your communication style, retrieves info from documents, evaluates responses for style and grounding, and books meetings if confidence is low.
- [Job Trucking](https://github.com/ipassynk/job-trucker-ai) Job trucking tool using RAG with Ollama, LangChain, ChromaDB, FastAPI, and Streamlit.
- [Recipe Keeper](https://github.com/ipassynk/recipe_keeper) A smart recipe management and search application powered by RAG. It uses a hybrid search approach combining structured graph data with Neo4j and vector embeddings with Weaviate to allow users to find recipes by ingredients, nutritional info, or even by image similarity.
- Building an AI-driven Contract Agent for a fireproofing and spray foam company using LangGraph and LlamaParse (LlamaIndex) to detect and parse new project contracts, enable chatting with Streamlit, and automate pre-production task management with Python and FastAPI on AWS.
- Medical receipts processing with Zapier AI agents, integrating Gmail, WhatsApp, Google Sheets, image/PDF parsing.
- Coach system handling a large number of concurrent curls via Nginx, and  built with  Python, Shell, and  Telegram bot.
